        Hello and welcome to my page! My name is Anthony Cunningham, I am 30
        years old and starting a new career in software development. I've had
        several different vocations over the years from construction to soldier,
        cannabis researcher to now software developer! I love anime and manga,
        many different types of art, and being out in nature. Also video games,
        I have been playing them since I can remember, with my first game ever
        being on the gameboy color.
